# Rails::Clue

Learn about different ActiveRecord query methods by playing a game of Clue. It's you against the database!

## Setup

1. Clone this repo! You can also fork it and then clone it if you want, I'm not the boss of you!
2. Run `bundle install`. This might take a few minutes. Don't be alarmed if it seems to get stuck on nokogiri... it'll move. Eventually.
3. Run `rails db:setup` in your terminal, from this directory.
4. Run `rails console` or `rails c` (they do the same thing, just one has fewer letters to type) in your terminal to start up the Rails console.
5. Follow along with the live demonstration! Or, if I'm not currently talking at you, feel free to putz around on your own.
6. If you got stuck on any of these steps and discovered a fix/workaround/magical incantation, feel free to submit a pull request to update these steps!
7. I love you!

## Reference

You may appreciate having access to the [ActiveRecord documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) if you want to fool around in the database on your own! Feel free to fork this repo and change the seed data to your liking if you so desire! The world (or, this database anyway) is your oyster!
